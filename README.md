# spring-mass-simulation
Simulation of a spring mass damper system, coded in Python and based off of FastLabTutorial's tutorial.

There are two versions of the program, one that implements Euler's method integration and another that uses a 4th order Runge-Kutta integration technique (considered to be more accurate). 
The two files are otherwise the same, plotting the same values over the same time intervals.
